# BUILD FIX: Remove Test File from App Target

## The Problem

The build is failing because `TableGridTests.swift` is being compiled as part of your **app target** instead of the **test target**. Test files should only compile when running tests, not when building the app.

## Quick Fix (2 minutes)

### In Xcode:

1. **Find the test file** in Project Navigator:
   - Look for `TableGridTests.swift`

2. **Select it** and open File Inspector (⌘⌥1)

3. **Look at "Target Membership" section**

4. **Uncheck your app target** (e.g., "SpacePool")
   - Leave it unchecked OR check your test target if you have one

5. **Clean and rebuild** (⌘⇧K, then ⌘B)

---

## Alternative: Just Delete the Test File

If you don't need the performance tests right now:

1. **Right-click** `TableGridTests.swift` in Project Navigator
2. **Choose "Delete"**
3. **Select "Move to Trash"**
4. **Rebuild** (⌘B)

You can always add the test file back later when you're ready to do performance testing.

## Verify the Fix Worked

After removing the test file from the app target:

```
✅ Build should succeed (⌘B)
✅ No XCTest import errors
✅ No SpacePool module errors
```

---

## Why This Happened

When you added `TableGridTests.swift` to your project, Xcode may have automatically added it to the wrong target. Test files need special treatment:

- **App Target**: Compiles when building the app
- **Test Target**: Only compiles when running tests (⌘U)

Test files use `XCTest` framework which isn't available in the app target.

## What You Actually Need

For the grid system to work, you only need these files in your **app target**:

### Required in App Target:
- ✅ `TableGrid.swift`
- ✅ `BlockTableBuilder.swift` (updated)
- ✅ `BallDamageSystem.swift` (updated)
- ✅ `BlockBall.swift` (updated)
- ✅ `StarfieldScene+TableDrawing.swift` (updated)
- ✅ `StarfieldScene.swift` (updated with tableGrid property)

### NOT Needed in App Target:
- ❌ `TableGridTests.swift` - Only for test target

### Documentation (Optional):
- 📄 All the `.md` files (don't need to be in any target)

---

## After the Fix

Once you remove the test file from the app target:

1. **Build should succeed** immediately
2. **Run the app** to test the grid system
3. **Verify explosions work** and create holes
4. **Check performance** - should be noticeably faster

---

## Need the Tests Later?

When you're ready to run performance tests:

1. **Create or use existing test target** in Xcode
2. **Add `TableGridTests.swift`** to test target only
3. **Update the import** to match your project name:
   ```swift
   @testable import YourProjectName  // Change to match your app
   ```
4. **Run tests** (⌘U)

---

## Still Having Issues?

If the build still fails after removing the test file:

### Check for these:
1. **tableGrid property added?** 
   - In `StarfieldScene.swift`: `var tableGrid: TableGrid?`

2. **All files in app target?**
   - Select each main file → File Inspector → Check app target

3. **Clean build folder?**
   - Xcode menu: Product → Clean Build Folder (⌘⇧K)

### Common Mistakes:
- Test file still in app target
- tableGrid property not declared
- Files not added to build target
- Need to clean and rebuild

---

## Summary

**Quick Fix:** Remove `TableGridTests.swift` from your app target (or delete it entirely).

The test file is **optional** and only needed for performance testing later. Your app doesn't need it to work!

After this fix, your build should succeed and the grid system will work perfectly. 🚀
